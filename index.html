Mallela Theertham is a wonderful waterfall situated close to Srisailam. This fall is about 58 km from Srisailam. This fall located amidst the cool dense forest of Nallamala is a perfect getaway from the crowd and pollution of city life. The second longest river in the country, River Krishna, flows through this forest.To reach this waterfall situated in the middle of dense forest one has to take 350 steps down. For those interested in adventure tourism and wildlife this is a perfect spot. 
                A walk through the forest enjoying the lush greenery of nature and clean fresh air is a refreshing experience. This serene fall totally worth the effort. One of the advantage of this fall is that one can go underneath and enjoy the cool water in the Mallela Theertham.</P>
